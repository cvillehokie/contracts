## Background
This was done for the Creating Data Products Course, by Johns Hopkins University at Coursera.org

### Why Federal Contracts

Why not? Aren't you curious about how our (US) government is spending it's money?
What I'd like to do:
- Discover where money is being spent
- Identify what types of organizations are winning contracts
- Identify the size of the organizations using our money!

### Where's the Data?

All this data is freely available!
* http://download.usaspending.gov/datadownlods/Contracts/988f3e3b/Data_Feed.csv
* Only - that's 405k contracts!
  + Much too large for this project.
  + I've randomly sampled it down to 5k

### Credits:
Some places I went for inspiration (but not all inclusive):

The data was taken from here:
http://download.usaspending.gov/datadownlods/Contracts/988f3e3b/Data_Feed.csv

However, it's over 400k lines - I did a random sample to bring it down to 20k
